# Soduko-Solver
* A Java-based Sudoku solver that uses a backtracking algorithm to solve any given Sudoku puzzle
 Sudoku Solver*
Overview
This project is a Java-based Sudoku solver that uses a backtracking algorithm to solve any given Sudoku puzzle. The current version of the project does not include a GUI (Graphical User Interface) or CLI (Command Line Interface), but it lays the groundwork for these features to be added in future versions.

Features
Solves any valid Sudoku puzzle: The solver can handle any 9x9 Sudoku grid with varying levels of difficulty.
Backtracking algorithm: The solver uses a recursive backtracking approach to fill in the grid and solve the puzzle.
Future Prospects:
GUI/CLI: Plans to add a user-friendly interface for interacting with the solver.
Optimization: Potential to improve the algorithm for faster solving times.
Puzzle Generator: Add functionality to generate Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulty levels.

Setup
Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK): Make sure you have JDK 8 or higher installed.
IDE: Any Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) for running and modifying the code.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/SudokuSolver.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd SudokuSolver
Compile the code (optional step if using an IDE):

bash
Copy code
javac -d bin src/com/sudoku/main/Main.java
Run the solver (optional step if using an IDE):

bash
Copy code
java -cp bin com.sudoku.main.Main
Usage
Input Format
The solver expects a 9x9 Sudoku grid as input, where empty cells are represented by 0.
The grid should be provided in a 2D integer array format within the code.
Example
Given the following unsolved Sudoku puzzle:

diff
Copy code
5 3 0 | 0 7 0 | 0 0 0
6 0 0 | 1 9 5 | 0 0 0
0 9 8 | 0 0 0 | 0 6 0
------+-------+------
8 0 0 | 0 6 0 | 0 0 3
4 0 0 | 8 0 3 | 0 0 1
7 0 0 | 0 2 0 | 0 0 6
------+-------+------
0 6 0 | 0 0 0 | 2 8 0
0 0 0 | 4 1 9 | 0 0 5
0 0 0 | 0 8 0 | 0 7 9
After running the solver, the completed grid will be:

diff
Copy code
5 3 4 | 6 7 8 | 9 1 2
6 7 2 | 1 9 5 | 3 4 8
1 9 8 | 3 4 2 | 5 6 7
------+-------+------
8 5 9 | 7 6 1 | 4 2 3
4 2 6 | 8 5 3 | 7 9 1
7 1 3 | 9 2 4 | 8 5 6
------+-------+------
9 6 1 | 5 3 7 | 2 8 4
2 8 7 | 4 1 9 | 6 3 5
3 4 5 | 2 8 6 | 1 7 9
Adding Your Own Puzzle
To solve your own Sudoku puzzle, modify the Main.java file to include your puzzle grid:

java
Copy code
int[][] board = {
    {5, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0},
    {6, 0, 0, 1, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0},
    {0, 9, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0},
    // Add the rest of your grid here
};
Then, run the application, and it will output the solved grid.

Documentation
Code Comments
The code is thoroughly commented to explain the logic and flow of the Sudoku solving algorithm. Each method includes inline comments that describe its purpose and functionality.
